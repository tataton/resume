      One of my goals was to use the flexbox CSS style (and its wrap setting) to help me organize the Education and Employment sections with varying browser width. (Say, to make the page display differently on a phone vs. a computer screen.)  I'm pretty sure I'm using the right, syntactically, but I need to think more about what it is I'm actually trying to do. This is where I am so far.
